## A Global Analysis of Cyber Threats to the Energy Sector — Code & Datasets

“Currents of Conflict” from a geopolitical perspective

Authors: Gustavo Sánchez, Ghada Elbez, Veit Hagenmeyer — Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)

The escalating frequency and sophistication of cyber threats increased the need for their comprehensive understanding. This paper explores the intersection of geopolitical dynamics, cyber threat intelligence analysis, and advanced detection technologies, with a focus on the energy domain. We leverage generative artificial intelligence to extract and structure information from raw cyber threat descriptions, enabling enhanced analysis. By conducting a geopolitical comparison of threat actor origins and target regions across multiple databases, we provide insights into trends within the general threat landscape. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of cybersecurity tools ---with particular emphasis on learning-based techniques--- in detecting indicators of compromise for energy-targeted attacks. This analysis yields new insights, providing actionable information to researchers, policy makers, and cybersecurity professionals.
